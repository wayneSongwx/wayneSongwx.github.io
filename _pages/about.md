Welcome to My Website!

Hello, I'm Wenxin Song! üëã

I‚Äôm a Master‚Äôs student in Computer Science at Columbia University, with a strong foundation in software engineering and full-stack development. Driven by a passion for creating impactful, user-centered applications, I bring experience in building end-to-end solutions using Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python, and SQL.

My recent projects include developing predictive analytics models and building EventEase, an accessible event management app tailored for the elderly. Additionally, I led the development of a full-stack project focused on event recommendations, where I implemented a content-based recommendation algorithm to enhance both user experience and recommendation accuracy. My two long-term research experiences have further strengthened my communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills, preparing me for dynamic team environments.

## üíº Professional Objective
I'm currently pursuing a Software Development Engineer (SDE) internship for Summer 2025, where I aim to leverage my technical expertise in a collaborative setting while learning from industry leaders.

## üî¨ Research Experience

- *2023.06 - 2023.10*, **University of Notre Dame**, South Bend, IN  
  **Research Assistant**  
  - Constructed an interactive sandbox to help users align privacy attitudes with behaviors through experiential learning in a risk-free environment, validated in a user study with 15 participants and 8 personas.
  - Led a 2-member team in developing backend services using Flask for persona generation and modification.
  - Generated comprehensive persona data with the GPT-4 API, including personal details, weekly schedules, browsing history, and social media posts, enhanced through few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought.
  - Designed and built a database component using SQLite3 and MySQL to store persona data.
  - Collaborated with a 5-member team to complete the research project, ensuring effective communication and alignment on technical goals, resulting in a publication at CHI 2024.

- *2022.08 - 2024.04*, **The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen**, Shenzhen, China  
  **Research Assistant**  
  - Led the development of a load generator to clone the performance of Spark applications without data leakage, achieving a 36.7% improvement in generation accuracy over conventional methods.
  - Set up a Hadoop and Spark cluster on Linux to collect and process load data efficiently.
  - Engineered an operator plan analyzer in Python, computing operator distributions from 1,000+ extracted plans with a 95% accuracy rate using Conditional Probability.
  - Processed and organized 100+ TPC-DS benchmark datasets, training an LSTM model in PyTorch to improve operator plan framework accuracy by 18%.
  - Developed a custom Python converter to translate operator plans into executable SQL queries, optimizing workflow efficiency by 15% and reducing processing time by 10%.
