## ðŸ”¬ Professional Experience
- *2022.08 - 2024.04*, **The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen**, Shenzhen, China  
  **Research Assistant (software development)**  
  *Supervisor: [Prof. Yung-Chun Chung](https://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~ychung/)
  - Led a team of 3 to develop a full-stack Spark load generation platform, combining Python-based LSTM models with Java (Spring Boot) to simulate application loads, achieving a 36.7% improvement in generation accuracy over standard approaches.
  - Trained an LSTM model using PyTorch to generate Spark workloads with high accuracy, packaged it as a microservice using FastAPI, integrated it into the backend via RESTful APIs, enabling seamless interaction and scalability.
  - Implemented RESTful APIs using Spring MVC to process user inputs and coordinate with the Python microservice.
  - Built and deployed a MySQL database on AWS RDS to store user configurations and historical load data, and integrated Google Cloud Storage for storage of output workloads, ensuring fast and reliable data retrieval.
  - Deployed the backend services to AWS EC2 with Docker, ensuring high availability and reducing latency by 10%.

- *2023.06 - 2023.10*, **University of Notre Dame**, South Bend, IN  
  **Research Assistant**  
  *Supervisor: [Toby Jia-jun Li](https://toby.li/)*
    - Developed an interactive sandbox enabling users to align privacy attitudes with behaviors through experiential learning in a risk-free environment. Effectiveness was proved in a user study with 15 participants and 8 personas;
    - Led a 2-member team in developing backend services using Flask to support persona generation and modification;
    - Generated comprehensive persona data using GPT-4 API, including personal information, weekly schedules, browsing history, and social media posts. The outputs were augmented by few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought;
    - Built the database component with SQLite3 and MySQL to store persona data;
    - Collaborated with a 5-member team in finishing the research project, ensuring clear communication and alignment on technical objectives, leading to the publication of research paper at CHI 2024.
