# ðŸš€ Welcome to Wayne's Website!

Hello, I'm Wenxin Song! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at Columbia University, with a strong foundation in software engineering and full-stack development. Driven by a passion for creating impactful, user-centered applications, I bring experience in building end-to-end solutions using Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python, and SQL.

My recent projects include developing predictive analytics models and building EventEase, an accessible event management app tailored for the elderly. Additionally, I led the development of a full-stack project focused on event recommendations, where I implemented a content-based recommendation algorithm to enhance both user experience and recommendation accuracy. 

My two long-term research experiences have further strengthened my communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills, preparing me for dynamic team environments.

## ðŸ’¼ Professional Objective
I'm currently pursuing a Software Development Engineer (SDE) internship for Summer 2025, where I aim to leverage my technical expertise in a collaborative setting while learning from industry leaders.
